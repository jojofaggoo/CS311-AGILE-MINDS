1. I completed the basic system layout and user navigation (User Story #7).
User Story #7 says the main form should have:
•	A button For Administrators
•	A button For Instructors
•	A button For Students
I completed this part.
My system now has:
•	A working MainForm
•	Three buttons for Admin, Instructor, and Student
•	Clicking each button opens the correct form
•	Each form loads successfully with no errors
•	
 
2. I created the required forms for each user type.
These forms now exist in the project:
•	AdminForm
•	InstructorForm
•	StudentForm
Each form opens correctly from the main menu.

3. I fixed naming issues and event handler problems.
During Sprint 1, I resolved:
•	InitializeComponent() errors
•	Event handler mismatches
•	Designer wiring issues (e.g., btnAdmin_Click_1)
•	Form renaming (Form1 → MainForm)
All forms now compile and run without errors.

Next Story #1 — Add instructors (User Story #1)
This will require:
•	Input fields
•	Save to database
•	Create instructor table
Next Story #2 — Add students (User Story #2)
This will require:
•	Student input fields
•	Save to database
Next Story #3 — Add new courses (User Story #3)
This includes:
•	Assign instructor
•	Seat count
•	Registration availability
These will all require connecting the system to the TCCM_DB.sql database.

These are some of the blocker that happen.
Blocker 1 — Buttons were not working
•	Caused by event handler names like btnAdmin_Click_1
•	Fixed by updating Designer event wiring
Blocker 2 — InitializeComponent() error
•	Caused by renaming Form1 incorrectly
•	Fixed by correcting names in .cs and .Designer.cs
Blocker 3 — Missing forms
•	Program crashed when AdminForm, InstructorForm, StudentForm didn’t exist
•	Fixed by creating each form properly
